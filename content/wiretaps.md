# wiretap percentage

- wiretaps (+5 per non-alarm connection and +5 bonus when all six connected)
- bugs (depends on the furniture)

* How does this relate to message/meeting detection?
* Does the quality of the detected events change based on percentage?
* Does rank or difficulty affect any formula?
