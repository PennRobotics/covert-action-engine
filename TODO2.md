SPNA
====

Pronounced S. P. N. A., or _"Espionah"_

This is a clone of the engine for the MPS Labs game, _Covert Action_.

The plan is to develop tools for extracting package data from the original game folder for conversion to an open format. The majority of string data are stored in the executable while picture and animation data are found in self-contained files.

Bases for the development of the engine are the source codes for Freeciv, Master of Orion, C-Dogs SDL, SDLPop (Prince of Persia), cc94 and FreeCol (Colonization), and Crown and Cutlass (Pirates!)
